              <h3>How was Meta Morph Established?</h3>
              <p id="paratime">
                <br />The B. Tech. Programme in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) started in the year 2017. Following this, Team Meta Morph was established by the first batch of B.Tech. MSE with the primary motive to facilitate novel interdisciplinary developments in the field of Materials Engineering and Materials Science both within the institute and beyond its walls. The name of the Team has its roots in the wonderful class of novel materials known as Metamaterials â€“ materials that showcase properties deviating from conventional standards. Our team had a distinct perception and vision. The desire to be unique in our endeavours has always been a natural disposition of the members of our team, and we proved the same during our first debut in NIMBUS 2019.
